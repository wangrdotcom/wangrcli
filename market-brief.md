Bitcoin dipped to $88,076.60, down 1.13% over 24 hours, signaling a modest short-term pullback.
Ether slid to $2,924.12 (-0.84%) and Solana to $125.98 (-0.82%), broadly tracking BTC's move.
On-chain and social sentiment remains cautiously bullish, with the community focused on accumulation and long-term conviction despite short-term noise.
Key near-term risks are ETF outflows, rotation into precious metals, and headlines around security or regulation that could spike volatility.
Actionable guidance: stagger entries (DCA) on dips, keep position sizing tight, and watch ETF flows and major security/regulatory updates for catalysts.
