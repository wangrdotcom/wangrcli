Key takeaways / next actions
- Market has sizable capital but a ~50/50 win-rate — a small set of top traders account for outsized realized gains.
- Monitor the top-by-PnL wallets for directional shifts or large new positions — they can rapidly move markets.
- Watch venues/markets driving recent volume; elevated volume + neutral win-rate increases short-term event risk.
- If you want immediate follow-ups: I can pull full trade histories, current open positions, or set alerts for any of the top wallets above.
